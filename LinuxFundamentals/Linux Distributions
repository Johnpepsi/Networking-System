Imagine Linux as a powerful engine running a computer, but on its own, it's just a skeleton. That's where Linux distributions come in, dressing up the Linux kernel with a complete operating system.

This course focuses on Debian Linux, specifically Ubuntu Server, which is a CLI-only operating system optimized for server use.

A Linux distribution, or distro, includes the Linux kernel and bundles software components like libraries, utilities, applications, and sometimes a GUI. Each distro has its own personality and goals, offering a customized flavor of Linux.

Below is a list of popular server-based distros:

Ubuntu Server
AlmaLinux
Debian Linux
Fedora Server
ArchLinux
openSUSE
Choosing the right distro depends on factors like prior Linux experience and personal preference. Key factors include:

Package Management System: Each distro has its own system for installing, removing, and updating software (e.g., APT for Debian/Ubuntu, DNF for Fedora).
Software Repository: Distributions have repositories with pre-compiled software packages. Using official repositories ensures trust and compatibility.
Default Desktop Environment: Server distros often lack a desktop environment, relying on the terminal for administration tasks.
Release Model: Some distros have fixed release cycles, while others follow a rolling release model, offering continuous updates.
